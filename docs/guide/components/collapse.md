# 折叠面板 Collapse

<BackTop />
<Watermark fullscreen content="Eh Antdesign UI" />

<br/>

*可以折叠/展开的内容区域*

## 何时使用

- 对复杂区域进行分组和隐藏，保持页面的整洁

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, watchEffect } from 'vue'

const collapseData = ref([
  {
    key: '1',
    header: 'This is panel header 1',
    text: 'A dog is a type of domesticated animal.Known for its loyalty and faithfulness,it can be found as a welcome guest in many households across the world.'
  },
  {
    key: '2',
    header: 'This is panel header 2',
    text: `  A dog is a type of domesticated animal.Known for its loyalty and faithfulness,it can be found as a welcome guest in many households across the world.
  A dog is a type of domesticated animal.Known for its loyalty and faithfulness,it can be found as a welcome guest in many households across the world.`
  },
  {
    key: '3',
    header: 'This is panel header 3',
    text: 'A dog is a type of domesticated animal.Known for its loyalty and faithfulness,it can be found as a welcome guest in many households across the world.'
  }
])
const activeKey = ref(['1'])
watchEffect(() => {
  console.log('activeKey:', activeKey.value)
})
const key = ref('1')
watchEffect(() => {
  console.log('key:', key.value)
})
function onChange (key: any) {
  console.log('change:', key)
}
</script>

## 基本使用

*activeKey 传入 `number[]` | `string[]`，所有面板可同时展开*

<br/>
